## hey, i'm maazin zaidi 👋
a self-proclaimed data scientist/engineer & part-time sketchpad enthusiast.

i graduated from NUST with a degree in Computer Engineering, majoring in AI, ML & Data Analytics (yeah, the buzzwords).  
since then, i’ve played around with computer vision for accessibility, built some django-powered stuff to make life easier, and tried to predict hospital chaos with time series data.  
also, don't let the tone fool you, i overthought every word of this readme.

## 🧠 what i do

😤 wrangle/clean/model (i'll use all the lingo idc) data with pandas, numpy, and a bit of ✨ hope ✨  
✍️ write overly-ambitious SQL & somewhat clean Python to survive real-word data  
🙏 build ML & NLP stuff that tries super hard to sound intelligent  
🔧 automate web scraping piplines with selenium, playwright and 2captcha - dw they don't crash (most of the time)  
📊 explore time series, regression models, and things that sound cooler than they are      
👀 hate development with a burning passion - yet still work on Django apps (i hate it here)  


## 🧪 some things i’ve built

**🎥 blind video description system**  
YOLO + MiDaS + BLIP + GPT-3: stitched together to narrate scenes for the visually impaired.  
probably the most ambitious thing i've built. also the most fun. i'm proud of this one.

**🏥 hospital capacity forecasting**  
pandas, streamlit, numpy: modeled chaotic time series data to help hospitals stay one step ahead.  
spoiler: hospitals are never one step ahead.

**:clapper: film database & ML pipeline**   
python, sqlite3: scraped data from the TMDB API and built a local SQLite database of english-language movies.  
learned way more than expected about sqlite3 in python, and how APIs sometimes send you 0 results just to mess with you.


## 🧰 tools i vibe with

`python` `pandas` `numpy` `scikit-learn` `tensorflow`  
`pytorch` `git` `jupyter`  `powerbi` `sqlite3`   


## 🫠 fun facts (things i probably shouldn't admit)
- i say "let me do this real quick" and lose an entire day
- i use `print()` debugging like it's 2012 (no regrets btw)
- i talk to my code like it's a person. "you had one job"
- i comment like i'm talking to a third grader (myself when i revisit the file)


## 🎨 hobbies
i try to sketch cities and interiors (i'm failing. miserably), write occasionally (no you can't read), doom-scroll (lol obviously), and tell myself i'm not procrastinating (~i am~).  
oh and i treat music discovery like a side quest
